Column title,Description of data
hydroID (GLAHF database),Unique identifier for individual tributary watersheds. HydroID numbers are directly from the Great Lakes Aquatic Habitat Framework database (glahf.org)
bottle/vial ID,Identifying vial labels for field samples. Bottle ID coincides with the order that the sample was collected.
stream name,The name of the tributary. 'No name' indicates that were unable to find an official tributary name. 
TPmgL,Total phosphorus concentration (mg/L)
TNmgL,Total nitrogen concentration (mg/L)
SRPmgL,Soluble reactive phosphorus concentration (mg/L)
NitratemgL,Nitrate+nitrite concentration (mg/L)
NH4mgL,ammonium concentration (mg/L)
DINmgL,Nitrate+nitrite+ammonium concentration (mg/L)
Flowlitersday,Discharge in liters/day for the 5 day period around the sampling event
TPload_kgday,Total phosphorus load (kg/day)
TNload_kgday,Total nitrogen load (kg/day)
SRP percent of TP,The percentage of TP composed of SRP ((SRP/TP)*100)
DIN percent of TN,The percentage of TN composed of DIN ((DIN/TN)*100)
Load N:P,Molar TN/Molar TP
urban,The percentage of the watershed considered urban
barren,The percentage of the watershed considered barren
forest,The percentage of the watershed considered forest
shrubland,The percentage of the watershed considered shrubland
herbaceous,The percentage of the watershed considered herbaceous 
agriculture,The percentage of the watershed considered agriculture
wetland,The percentage of the watershed considered wetland
Strahler order,The strahler order of the tributary
Areakm2,The area of the watershed (km2)
damspresent,"Yes' indicates that there are dams within the watershed, 'No' indicates the absence of dams within the watershed"
percent water,The contribution a single tributary made to the total tributary derived hydraulic load during the sampling period
percent TP,The contribution a single tributary made to the total tributary derived TP load during the sampling period
percent TN,The contribution a single tributary made to the total tributary derived TN load during the sampling period
